# Snake Juice AI

## Description
This project aims to monitor and analyze EEG brainwave patterns during a 96-hour snake juice fast using the Neurosity Crown. The goal is to identify critical intervals for intervention to mitigate symptoms of hunger and food withdrawal, and gain a neuroscientific understanding of the fasting process inherent in the Snake Diet protocol by Cole Robinson.

## What Is The Snake Diet?
The Snake Diet is a fasting-focused lifestyle that promotes prolonged fasting periods. It was created by Cole Robinson, a personal trainer, with the goal of promoting rapid weight loss and health benefits through a regimen of extended fasting and minimal eating. The diet's name is derived from the idea that humans should mimic the eating patterns of wild snakes, which eat large meals infrequently and go fasted for long periods. Hence Cole's catchphrase: "EAT BIG. FAST LONG." 

A central component of the Snake Diet is "Snake Juice," a homemade electrolyte drink that includes water, potassium chloride, sodium chloride (salt), and food-grade Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate). This drink is intended to replenish electrolytes during the fasting period.

The diet typically starts with an initial fasting phase that can last for 48 hours or more, followed by a feeding window where specific foods are consumed, and then a return to fasting. The durations of these phases can vary based on individual goals and tolerance.

## Installation
1. **Neurosity Crown Setup**: Follow the manufacturer's guidelines to set up the Neurosity Crown.
2. **Software Setup**: Install Python, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, and relevant libraries (SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Plotly).
3. **Clone the Repository**: git clone [https://www.github.com/erosmarcello/snakejuiceai]

## Usage
- **Script Execution**: Run the provided scripts for baseline data collection, continuous monitoring, and data analysis.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Use the real-time visualization tools to monitor EEG patterns during the fast.
- **Data Analysis**: After the fast, use the analysis scripts to compare and analyze pre, during, and post-fast data.

## Hardware Requirements
- Neurosity Crown
- A stable internet connection for cloud computing (optional)

## Software Requirements
- Neurosity SDK
- Python 3.x
- JavaScript
- Visual Studio Code
- Git and GitHub

## Safety Warning
- **Medical Supervision**: It is highly recommended to undertake this project under medical supervision.
- **Health Risks**: Be aware of the health risks associated with prolonged fasting.

## Data Collection
- **Baseline Data**: Collect baseline EEG data for comparison.
- **Continuous EEG Monitoring**: Record EEG data continuously during the 96-hour fast.

## Data Analysis
